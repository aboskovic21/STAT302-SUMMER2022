If you can’t make my office hours, please\nsend me an email or a message on Canvas, and we can find a time to\nmeet!\nNote: When emailing either the instructor or grader,\nplease include “[STAT 302]” at the beginning of the email header! It\nwill help us respond to you faster.\nOverview\nThis course aims to help you build a foundation of computational\nskills for data analysis. Data encountered in real world applications\nare usually context-dependent and messy, breaking many of the\nassumptions we make in typical statistics courses. Properly analyzing\nsuch data can require us to develop and build our own tools–ideally in a\nway that others are able to use and even extend our methods. Throughout\nthis course, we will practice using computers to help us understand,\nsummarize, visualize, and model complex data in a reproducible way.\nStudents are assumed to have an introductory knowledge of statistics,\nbut no formal computational training. All material is taught using the R\nstatistical programming language. This course emphasizes:\nApplication over theory: This course does not\naim to teach you statistics: we will briefly review the theory behind\nsome of the methods covered in the course, but our focus will be\nimplementation and application to data analysis.\nBest practices for coding: We will dedicate a\nsubstantial amount of time to concepts such as commenting code, code\nstyle, documentation, version control, and related topics. These skills\nmight seem tedious at first, but by building good habits, you will save\nyourself a lot of time and trouble in the future.\n“Real world” workflow: Assignments and projects\nin this course will ask you to take the tools we study and develop\nthroughout the course and apply them to realistic research problems. You\nwill be asked to practice the full “workflow” of data analysis, from\ndata cleaning and debugging to collaboration and presentation. A well\ndesigned and implemented project can demonstrate your practical\nexperience and training to others, including future employers.\nOutline\nIn this course, we will learn fundamental concepts related to\nprogramming, statistical computing, and data analysis. Points of\nemphasis include:\nProgramming fundamentals\nData visualization\nData cleaning/manipulation\nVersion control and git\nDebugging\nComputation for statistical inference\nComputation for statistical prediction\nCourse structure\nTypically, each 80 minute class session will be broken up into a 45\nminute lecture, a 5 minute break, and a 30 minute lab. Lab time will be\nan opportunity for you to practice coding, work collaboratively on\nassignments, and ask for help. Most topics in lecture will last two\nclass periods.\nShort Labs: You will be assigned six short labs\nthroughout the quarter. These are designed to be completed during lab or\nshortly after and will be due at the start of the next class. At the end\nof the quarter, your lowest Short Lab grade will be dropped. They will\nbe graded on the following two point scale:\n0: indicates incomplete or unacceptable work\n1: indicates a good faith effort towards completing >75% of the\nassignment\n2: indicates a good faith effort towards completing the entire\nassignment.\n\nLabs: You will be assigned four labs throughout\nthe quarter. These are extended, more complicated assignments that you\nwill likely not be able to complete during class. They will be due at\nthe start of the next class.\nProjects: Instead of exams, you will be assigned\nthree projects throughout the course. We will dedicate at least two lab\nsessions to each project and you will have about one week to complete\neach.\nProject 1 focuses on data manipulation and visualization.\nProject 2 focuses on simulation.\nProject 3 focuses on building statistical software\n\nLate Work: In general, the late policy is as\nfollows: Any assignment that is received late but less than 24 hours\nlate will receive a grade penalty of 25%. Any assignment that is\nreceived 24–48 hours late will receive a grade penalty of 50%.\nAssignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours late. That\nsaid, if you communicate directly with me before an assignment is due, I\nwill often be willing to relax a deadline.\nGrading\nYour final grade will be calculated as follows:\n20%: Short Labs\n25%: Labs\n15%: Minimum grade from Project 1 and Project 2\n20%: Maximum grade from Project 1 and Project 2\n20%: Project 3\n2% (extra credit): Extra credit homework assignment at the end of\nthe quarter.\nHybrid Course Structure\nSummer 2022\nIn order to best accommodate everyone’s choices for their safety\nduring the pandemic, this will be a hybrid course. Feel free to come in\nperson all the time, on some days, or never. I will never judge you for\nhow you choose to engage in this course. My top priority is your\nlearning, and if you feel safer, more comfortable, or learn more\neffectively by attending class on Zoom, please feel free to do so. All\nclasses will be recorded and accessible under the Zoom tab on Canvas and\nby then accessing “Cloud Recordings.”\nExpectations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to present many of us\nwith unforeseen difficulties. I encourage all of you to prioritize the\nhealth and safety of yourselves and those around you and would be happy\nto make accommodations that help you to do so. Please feel free to reach\nout to me via email at any point to discuss any concerns you may have\nabout the course.\nKeeping each other safe\nAs we return to physical classrooms, please be respectful of your\nclassmates’ boundaries and precautions. In addition, I hope we will all\nmake every effort to keep ourselves and our classmates safe. If you test\npositive or are exposed to possible infection, I encourage you to err on\nthe side of caution with regards to attending classes in-person, and I\nwould be more than happy to make accommodations that allow you to do\nso.\nClassroom environment\nNames & Pronouns\nEveryone deserves to be addressed as they would like. Feel free to\nsend us your preferred name and correct pronouns at any time.\nPersonal computers\nIf you do not have a personal computer, you can borrow one for free\nfrom UW through the Student Technology Loan Program. In general, if you\nhave trouble accessing a computer, please contact me so we can make sure\nyou have the resources you need to learn.\nFeedback\nI encourage and appreciate your feedback throughout the quarter. You\nare welcome to provide feedback on any aspect of the course at any time\nvia email or in person. If you would prefer to do so confidentially, you\ncan do so through the form here.\nCollaboration\nOn most assignments, collaboration is allowed and encouraged. You may\ndiscuss problems, approaches, and solutions with your classmates.\nAcceptable collaboration is limited to your classmates in this course\nand you must clearly include on any collaborative work the name(s) of\nanyone with whom you worked.\nAdditionally, all submitted work must be your own; you should not\nsubmit code or answers copied from any resource including your\nclassmates. Plagiarism and cheating is easy for us to detect and can\nlead to serious negative consequences for you (see Academic Integrity\nbelow). If you have any questions regarding this policy, please ask for\nclarification.\nDiscussion board\nYou are encouraged to participate on the discussion board by posting\nquestions about assignments and answering questions from other students.\nPosts may not include substantial amounts of code that can be used for a\nsolution to any problem, but may include code snippets within\nreason.\nAcademic misconduct\nAcademic integrity is essential to this course and to your learning.\nOn certain assignments, collaboration is allowed and encouraged when\nfollowing the collaboration policy outlined above. Violations of the\nacademic integrity policy include but are not limited to: copying from a\npeer, collaborating where it is not allowed, copying from an online\nresource, using a solutions manual, and using resources from a previous\niteration of the course. Anything found in violation of this policy will\nbe automatically given a score of 0 with no exceptions. If the situation\nmerits, it will also be reported to the UW Student Conduct Office, at\nwhich point it will be out of my hands. If you have any questions about\nthis policy, please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.\nThe university’s policy on plagiarism and academic misconduct is a\npart of the Student Conduct Code, which cites the definition of academic\nmisconduct in the WAC 478-121. (WAC is an abbreviation for the\nWashington Administrative Code, the set of state regulations for the\nuniversity. The entire chapter of the WAC on the student conduct code is\nhere http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html)\nAccording to this section of the WAC, academic misconduct includes:\n“Cheating”—such as “unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes”,\n“Falsification” “which is the intentional use or submission of falsified\ndata, records, or other information including, but not limited to,\nrecords of internship or practicum experiences or attendance at any\nrequired event(s), or scholarly research”; and “Plagiarism” which\nincludes “[t]he use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published\nor unpublished work of another person without full and clear\nacknowledgment.”\nThe UW Libraries have a useful guide for students at http://www.lib.washington.edu/teaching/plagiarism\nStudents found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero\non the assignment (or other possible outcome).\nConduct\nThe University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121)\ndefines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the\nUniversity holds students accountable as they pursue their academic\ngoals. Allegations of misconduct by students may be referred to the\nappropriate campus office for investigation and resolution. More\ninformation can be found online at https://www.washington.edu/studentconduct/.\nDisability Resources\nYour experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy\nand practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and\naccessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.\nIf you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources\nfor Students (DRS), please activate your accommodations via myDRS so we\ncan discuss how they will be implemented in this course.\nIf you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a\ntemporary health condition or permanent disability that requires\naccommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health,\nattention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health\nimpacts), contact DRS directly to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates\nthe interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations.\nContact DRS at http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/\nDiversity, equity and\ninclusion\nDiverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to\nthe critical thinking endeavor at the heart of university education.\nTherefore, I expect you to follow the UW Student Conduct Code in your\ninteractions with your colleagues and me in this course by respecting\nthe many social and cultural differences among us, which may include,\nbut are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity,\nfamily status, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and\nimmigration status, national origin, race, religious and political\nbeliefs, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran\nstatus.\nReligious accommodations\nWashington state law requires that UW develop a policy for\naccommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons\nof faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s\npolicy, including more information about how to request an\naccommodation, is available at https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/.\nAccommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this\ncourse using the https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/\nStudent privacy\nNote that the software used in this class (e.g. Canvas, Zoom,\nPanopto) when used with our UW Net IDs, are FERPA compliant (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). This\nmeans they do not monitor student use of their service and they do not\nshare student data with third parties.\nSharing recordings and other class materials outside of class that\ninclude personally identifiable student information without the written\nconsent of those students is a violation of FERPA. State law requires\nconsent from people to be recorded (https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030),\nplease note that (1) that your participation in this class indicates\nyour consent for course activities to be recorded, (2) you are not\npermitted to make your own recordings without consent from the\ninstructor and everyone else involved, and (3) that the instructor’s\nrecordings will be available for later playback only to students taking\nthe course. For more information about privacy concerns, review the UW\nPrivacy Office policies (https://privacy.uw.edu/policies/best-practices-online-conferencing/),\nor contact Helen Garrett, the UW’s FERPA Officer.\nLinks and other resources\nCanvas\nPage\nInstall R\nInstall\nRStudio\nInstall\nRMarkdown\nRStudio\nCheatsheets\n\n\n\n",
